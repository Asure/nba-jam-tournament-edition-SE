What's new?
===========

Welcome to release 5.02 of this 'Special Edition'. It's taken quite some time to get to this point.
In fact, it took nearly 17 months since the original SE 5.0 edition. A personal (non-lethal) health issue caused
me to halt work on many of my projects and focus on other matters.

I've decided to slowly cherry-pick projects after getting some assistance of others who can work with me.
I know these kind of games do not appeal to an extremely large number of people. But, as i have stated before
i am not in it for money or fame. I just love this game, and many others from Midway. Playing it reminds me of
all the fun moments i had in arcades as a teenager.


Quality-of-life
===============

Several options are now available in the CMOS menu under 'EXTRA SETTINGS'. This includes some permanent powerups
that were hard to do with a keyboard, and simple improvements. These are all operator adjustable now and can
make for some fun games. The signature 'idiot' aka 'bozo' boxes that explain the game to new players are now
disabled by default, and won't interrupt friendly matches between guests at your house who don't have a player
record stored.

Expanded roster and Grand Champion team unlock can be toggled when desired to add more depth to the game and
bring some exiting new players into teams that you maybe never saw.

Big Head was already in the CMOS options, but now you can also play as tiny ballers, enable max power to avoid
most of the shoving, and have the chance of your shot going in displayed below the credit/free play box.

Note that some of these options are for all players, including the CPU and can drastically change gameplay. 
Except the 'Idiot' boxes, these options area all turned off by default!

Restored stuff
==============
There's some nice stuff that was cut from TE so we brought it back. And some disabled stuff was enabled.
You can now enjoy the hidden tank game again, but with a simpler button press. (not from attract!)
Griffey now has his birthday as his code, and he's got voice samples to match.
Laimbeer, Petrovic and Lewis are back, with samples. But Hunter, Benjamin and Gamble had to go for now.
Some players were moved to other teams to create a more finetuned selection.

And offcourse, Jordan & Shaq are back in the game for all to enjoy, with voice samples!

Extra care was taken for proper head-body alignment and matching skin pallettes. Did i mention this is not
a hex-edited rom, but compiled from original source?

Speaking of source, there are some examples where changes from Midway caused some of Kitzrow's classics to never
be called during gameplay. I'm not sure if that's by design, but the game now has a chance to curse, call out
a nice Rainbow shot and make a comment about shoes again.

Removed stuff
=============
In order to fit in the new players with the mugshots and all 16 head angles, most of the hidden design team has
the head angles reduced. Many of the hiddens already had the 'basic' 5 head angles, and this was the only way to make
room without dropping any other players. We could have added extra data but this would mean you had to upgrade
the ROM mapper PAL chip and burn 27C080 instead. This would mean that for a few MB of data you would be burning
a whopping 16x27C080. (And much of those chips would not be fully filled anyway.)

No, we didn't touch the MK2 characters heads, they all have the 'deluxe' set of angles :)

Raiden has his signature sparks back, those were previously only for Boon and Tobias and Raiden was simply
commented out. 

Some unused voice samples had to go. Alley-oops were never in this game. Guess we'll see you in Hangtime ;)

Other
=====
There is now a credits screen that warns you to the full extent of the jam.
I've taken in all of the stuff posted on forums and where possible, added or fixed it.
Gameplay is not tweaked or touched, this is still as difficult as it was, just like Midway intended it to be.
If you want to beat the game, learn the tricks against the CPU.

Hint: From a code perspective, you can hear when it adjusts the drone skill.. 
Score called out (upby/downby), organ sounds, crowd..

We did our best to balance the new players, but just remember that you'll face them on a CPU team as well!

What's left?
============
There is very little GFX rom space left to do anything substantial at this point without cutting down
some of the big space eaters like the cheerleader images or change the title screen to a non-animated version.
Those can be stuffed into the main program area as zipped data. The effort is not really worthwhile so
I guess this will likely be the last release for T-Unit based boards.

I'll port the new changes to the Midway WOLF architecture in a future update.
There is nearly unlimited GFX space on that board, which would allow us to go crazy. No promises, no demands.

I've used the little available space to put a familiar face in the game to 'cheer on' as the CPU dunks against you.

Future
======
- Wolf Unit port will be ready when it's done. (New features/players/development is frozen for now.)
- Some big plans for (Max) Hangtime are underway.
- MK2 might appear on Wolf unit someday.
- When i feel much better

Enjoy!

Notes:
======
We still need testers for both Wolf and T-Unit that are dedicated and willing.
This release was not tested on real hardware, i lack the time and don't have any spare boards/roms.
I don't take requests for features. There is no space to add your face in the game.

Feedback is appreciated at the usual places. Don't sell this stuff, it's free to enjoy.
All done from source, using time-period correct dev environment in DosBox.
