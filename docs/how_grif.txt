How i added griffey (heads)
===================
What i probably did..


Searched thru LOD files: find his heads in BB3.LOD

kengrif.img
---> KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05

Go up in the LOD file to see where the lod would output this data to.

GLO> IMGTBL4.GLO
ASM> plyrhd4.tbl

Find the .asm/axx where these TBL/GLO were included. It's PLYRAT.ASM
Find the used names etc.

KG_H	;GRIFFEY
	.long	KGRIF01
	.long	KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05
	.long	KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05
	.long	KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05
	.long	KGRIF03

You can use a named var if it is .included
The .GLO file does:
1. create a .ref if the var is not defined 
2. create a .def if it is defined.

If a var is .DEFined, it is exported by the OBJ and can later be found by the GSPLNK command when the .out is built.
So the linker can link to it from other.asm files that .REFer it.

Ok so if you run IMGT.BAT in the BB3 folder it outputs files into c:\tmp\jamse\bb3
Check plyrhd4.tbl

KGRIF01:
	.word   28,34,13,31
	.long   05feabe6H
	.word   06000H
	.long   KGRIF_P
	.word   -1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Note the PAL here KGRIF_P is in IMGTBL4.GLO
Actual PAL data is in c:\tmp\IMGPAL.ASM

At this point all your data is in C:\tmp and nothing is yet in the actual game source folder.
Don't just overwrite the existing stuff yet!!

I seem to have added KGRIF_P data into IMGPAL3.ASM/AXX as it's .include in plyrat.axx

	.include	"imgpalp.asm"
	.include	"imgpal3.asm"
	.include	"imgtbl4.glo"
	.include	"plyrhd4.tbl"

Adding others
