Room needed.
We cut some head angles and adjust the game to use the cut-down version.

Target
VIKAPE

LOD: Edited, these remain:
---> VIKAPE01,VIKAPE02,VIKAPE03,VIKAPE04,VIKAPE05,VIKAPE16

Numbered VIKAPE* exists in IMGTBL4.GLO. Cut heads removed there.
Numbered VIKAPE* exists in PLYRHD4.TBL.

PLYRAT.AXX holds the head table. Edited to remove the cut heads.

Viking Ape / KONGO / KING KONG is KNG 26 mar

MAME test with non-updated rom data, Kongo is still doing fine with his heads.

(Note that Griffey is now broken since his head data is at a wrong offset and we are still compiling with the 
old PLYRHD4.TBL.)


Now we can make a new BB3.BIN and see how much rom space it gives us.
924842 bytes vs. 943778 

Mame loading BB3 reports 0x7FA2A9 is end, so 7FA2AA-7FFFFF is free for use.

Test: Add Jordan's heads and mug in there to check. (we end up at 7FB4E7)
Test: Add Jordan's Mug (we end up 7FC4BD!)

We need to check if Jordan's mug and heads work..
We need to fix Griffey as well at this point.

Test: We need to add the new 
PLYRHD4.TBL (manual move the updated GRIFFEY: nameplate/scorep into.. IMGTBL.ASM)
IMGTBL4.GLO (manual need to remove SCOREP and GRIFFEY globals from this one.)
IMGPAL3.ASM (manual need to remove SCOREP and GRIFFEY pals from this one.)
(FIRESEQ.TBL did not change.)

into main codebase. Old renamed to .bak

Game now compiles OK.
Testing with new .bin, we need to check Griffey, as his heads and nameplate are in the end of the file.

Everything is OK. 
Moved Grif 03 head a bit to the left so it aligns better.
Moved Grif 05 head more center.

Added Jordan nameplate "JORDAN/ pal JORDANP" to .LOD (933666 ->933929 bytes)
