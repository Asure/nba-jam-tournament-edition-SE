Mapping IRW files to mame GFXROM area
=====================================

- You can find the first used mem pointer in the first TBL file from the LOD.
- Here's a handy table to avoid you some work:

FILE		Start:          End:		First TBL:	Content:
BB2		0x0000000	0x03BF10F	LEDS.TBL	Willie main anims, dunks from JAM. Fonts and more.
BBMUG		0x03C1400	0x04CE7BD	MUGSHOT.TBL	Mugshots, heads, special guests
BB		0x04CE7BD	0x0?		COURT.TBL	More heads, backgrounds, Willie (body)
BB3		0x0718600	0x07FFFFF	FIRESEQ.TBL	Fatality, new dunks, new TE player heads.

(A nice picture would be good to have to show some bars what goes where.)

Loading irw/bin into Mame debug
===============================

MAME debug commands to load these from the mame folder:

loadr bb2.bin,0,0,:gfxrom  (0-3bf10f)
loadr bbmug.bin,3C1400,0,:gfxrom  - lod = 3e0a000 3C14000   = -1f6000
loadr bb.bin,4CE7BD,0,:gfxrom  
loadr bb3.bin,718600,0,:gfxrom  

One-shot copypaste command:

loadr bb2.bin,0,0,:gfxrom; loadr bbmug.bin,3C1400,0,:gfxrom ; loadr bb.bin,4CE7BD,0,:gfxrom ;loadr bb3.bin,718600,0,:gfxrom  

Notes
=====

- Data must fit into the 0x0 - 0x7FFFFF area defined in the MAME source.
- You can have some stuff above: mame uses ROM_REGION( 0xc00000, "video", 0 )
- Real PCB can only manage 7FFFFF in total. (MK2 has more, special rom board/GAL chip to decode this.)
- loadr debug command does not know size and/or boundaries so you can end up overwriting stuff if your bin is large.

LOD notes:
On a real board the cpu sees the GFX area starting at 0x2000000
So if you're working on a LOD and want some data at specific locations, add 0x2000000
The ***> command does this at the start of BB2.LOD: ***> 2000000 to ensure proper placing.
They do it in all the other .LOD files as well.

Archeology
==========
How they added Griffey to the original NBA JAM TE? 

- They removed RAY_GAY mugshot from BBMUG
- Added Griffeys mugshot and name label (TVSCORE)
- They removed some heads from BB3.LOD, RAYGAY got cut and TOBIAS got his head angles limited to 5 instead of 16.
- Added Griffey heads in BB3.LOD
- They probably manually updated the TBL files with the content instead of a full rebuild it seems.

We can rebuild both BBMUG and BB3 with the LOAD.EXE tools we have.
There's issues with the other lod files, mainly because of old TROG.IMG font they kept using.
Perhaps they ran into the same issue?

Since they didn't touch BB / BB2 we can re-use those original TE roms on a real PCB and the 
update was just 4x27C040 chips to mail to Griffey jr.
