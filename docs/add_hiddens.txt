Cheat sheet
===========
What to add where.

Heads		PLYRHD4.TBL	IMGPAL3.ASM 	IMGTBL4.GLO
Nameplate	IMGTBL.ASM	- none -	IMGTBL.GLO  	(uses global pal "scorep")
Mug		MUGSHOT.TBL	IMGPALM.ASM	IMGTBLM.GLO	(griffey in the wrong place (IMGPALP_. oops.)

Short list:
===========
Lots of manual labour. But it's like this:

Add heads to plyrhd4.tbl
Add head table to plyrat.axx
Add player data to plyrat.axx spechds_t (ex. position 69)
Add player name to speech.axx special_name_speech table @ pos 69
Add player name to speech.axx special_pass_speech @ pos 69
Add player to SELECT2.AXX fgatteam_inits @ pos 69
Add player to SELECT2.AXX fgatteam_snds @ pos 69
Add player to SELECT2.AXX player_attribs table. (this is just the gfx representation btw.) @ pos 69
Add player mug to SELECT2.axx our_heads table. @ pos 69
Add player nameplate SCORE2.axx to our_names table. @ pos 69

Note! Tables must all match up or strange stuff will happen in the game when it reads random wrong data.
(ex. wrong nameplate, wrong sound calls crashing sound board, wrong GFX crashing the DMA2 dsp.. etc.)	


Heads

kengrif.img
---> KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05

GLO> IMGTBL4.GLO
ASM> plyrhd4.tbl

Find the .asm/axx where these TBL/GLO were included. It's PLYRAT.ASM
Find the used names etc.

KG_H	;GRIFFEY
	.long	KGRIF01
	.long	KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05
	.long	KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05
	.long	KGRIF01,KGRIF02,KGRIF03,KGRIF04,KGRIF05
	.long	KGRIF03

This data appears to be non-sequential, we would have seen Malone last here otherwise.
TEST: Add MJ_H with JORDAN1 etc, this works.
TEST: Temp replace Grif heads with Jordan 

Q: Where is the actual player data?
A: The special heads table in plyrat.axx


;Size, speed, shot%, dunks, block defense, steals, drone skill
;Flesh pal, Pri uniform pal, Alt uniform pal, Pri trim pal, Alt trim pal, head
;Pass ability, power, clutch

spechds_t
	LWWWWWW	scale610_t,BV9,SHT9,DNK9,DEF7,SDEF7,DSKL3
	.long	FL34_p, Un12_p,Un14_p, TR2_p,TR7_p,KG_H
	.word	6,9,9	

Q: Is this aligned with other stuff like i found in Hangtime?
A: SPEECH.AXX?

SPEECH.AXX holds some tables with 68 entries for the specials:

special_name_speech 
	.word	0f980H,37,080c5H,0	;68 MALONE
special_pass_speech
	.word	0f980H,40,080faH,0	;68 TO MALONE

There is also the normal players in two tables here.

name_speech
pass_speech 

One would assume adding some player in the middle, we need to shift these tables accordingly.

Selectable
==========
SELECT2.AXX has fgatteam_inits and fgatteam_snds, there's a double MALONE, WHY? ALready an extra?
mug is in our_heads table. mug pal should be IMGPALM.ASM and IMGTBLM.GLO
