The court is stored from left to right in 4 images in COURTZ.IMG:

CRT1 274x138
CRT2 364x138
CRT3 365x138
CRT4 274x138

Total court size: 1546x138

To get the COURT.BIN so we can use it in FRM> for LOD files:

1. In IT Mark the images with spacebar. (for example in COURTZ.IMG you would mark CRT1 CRT2 CRT3 CRT4)
2. Go to the main menu of IT and select "MAIN -> RAW SAVE" to output the data as raw pixels in one file.
3. Use the FRM command to load this raw data in a LOD FRM> COURT.BIN
4. Note that this raw data does not include a palette

The court PAL is from UPCOURT_P and gets loaded using BB.LOD as part of a set of dummy images that have the
PAL attached to them. (PAL_IMG*)
