Building code
=====================================

The current codebase should be set up to compile cleanly. If not check GIT for history and things i might have borked.

If you don't want to mod the included dosbox conf files, it's best to set up in the same folder structure i use.

Your code should go in C:\MYJAMSE on the virtual dosbox root drive.
This is set up to use my D:\DOSBOX\TOOLS\C drive as root.
You would have a folder called C:\DOSBOX\TOOLS\C\MYJAMSE with *.asm/*.axx and so on inside it.
For debugging it is preferred to also have a D:\MAME with a normal D:\MAME\ROMS\NBAJAMTE.ZIP rom in it.

If you do use a different dosbox C: root folder you will need to edit \dosbox-x\dosbox-x.conf included in the repo.
Section [autoexec]: 

mount c d:\dosbox\tools\c	;change this to your dosbox virtual C root.
..
cd myjamse			;change this to your jam SE code folder.



Dosbox
======

Code builds in an emulated dosbox environment. I use Dosbox-X installed into C:\dosbox-x
The REBUILD.CMD command will launch that like this: 

c:\dosbox-x\dosbox-x.exe -conf .\dosbox-x\dosbox-x.conf

The included dosbox-x.conf has an [autoexec] section at the bottom of the conf file that cleans old files, then 
builds and links the code.

--- dos commands in [autoexec] section ---
gspa imgtbl.asm
gspa bgndtbl.asm
gmake -m
pause
cd rom
call ff8.bat
------------------------------------------

The FF8.BAT file uses the old BIGSREC.exe tool to create 4 files.
Once this is all done, execution of the REBUILD.CMD file resumes.
Our merge-tunit.cmd will run as part of the rebuild.cmd command file, and create the UG12 and UJ11 files with the
program code inside them. GFX roms are ready and included in the ROM folder.

To test your results, you should put all the rom files inside a NBAJAMTE.ZIP donor file.
just overwrite all the old files. If your donor has different names, make sure to delete them as MAME prefers to load
the files based on CRC and will just use the original TE gfx.

Feel free to edit both REBUILD.CMD and MERGE-TUNIT.CMD files to ensure the program code gets zipped into your MAME
folder \ roms zip file. It's part of my debugging setup.
