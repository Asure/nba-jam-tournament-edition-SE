===========================================================
This is for the special edition. To confirm some things on files already present:
IMGPAL.ASM  - This is the one from BB.LOD
IMGPAL2.ASM - This is the one from BB2.LOD. It's edited to include IMGTBL2.GLO, assumed renamed from BB2.LOD.
IMGPAL3.ASM - This is the one from BB3.LOD.   .inc IMGTBL.GLO?
IMGPALM.ASM - This is the one from BBMUG.LOD. .inc IMGTBL.GLO?
IMGPALP.ASM - This is the one from BBPAL.LOD. .inc IMGTBL.GLO?
IMGTBL.ASM - Looks a lot like the one from BB.LOD but 91518 91450 and content differs.

Included version:

Note: need to remove the /E parameter from load2.exe generation, this is not dual banked, it's T-Unit!(done)

Testing: Let's keep the old imgtbl.asm for now. Guess it's tied into rom?


===========================================================
This is where we look at MK2 and NBA JAM TE

IMGTBL.ASM -  	.include imgtbl.glo , 	.include bgndtbl.glo, that's all.

IMGTBL.GLO - 235 globals.
IMGTBL2 - IMGTBL7.GLO, loose files. All the content is together in IMGTBL.GLO. Nothing references these .glo files at any point.

IMGPAL2.ASM - IMGPAL7.ASM, loose files. All .include IMGTBL.GLO

MK2:
NO IMAGES ARE IN IMGTBL.GLO
ONLY PALs are in IMGTBL.GLO

BB.AXX

	.include	"imgtbl.glo"  ? Was included in src. Probably from BB.LOD?
	.include	"imgtblp.glo" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" ? from bb2.lod (uncertain)
	.include	"imgpalp.asm" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgpal2.asm" ? from bb2.lod (certain)

PLYR.AXX 
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" ? from bb2.lod (uncertain)

PLYRAT.AXX
	.include	"imgpalp.asm" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgpal3.asm" ? from bb3.lod (guess! YES)
	.include	"imgtbl4.glo" ? from bb3.lod
	.include	"plyrhd4.tbl" ? from bb3.lod

PLYR3.AXX
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo"
	.include	"bgndtbl.glo"

	.include	"plyrhd2.tbl"
	.include	"imgtblm.glo" ? from BBMUG?
	.include	"imgtbl3.glo" ? from BBMUG?
	.include	"plyrhd3.tbl"

obj's compiled, symbol ref errors.
Easy first. DIAGP in TEST.OBJ
	.include	"imgtbl.glo" does it have DIAGP? Why not?
- it does not have DIAGP
- DIAGP: not in BB.LOD. it is in IMGPAL.ASM from BB2.LOD
- IMGPAL2.ASM is not build as OBJ. Lets do that. And include imgtbl2.glo.
This solves TEST.OBJ!
---
Harder second. SELECT2.OBJ lots. Focus on.. BUTT_P - in IMGTcBL.GLO from BB.LOD and in IMGTBL.ASM.
Needed to replace mostly blank IMGTBL.ASM, see .bak
lots of bmod. BGNDTBL.ASM was fudged from the start for some reason.

score.obj
arwbp
IMGPAL.ASM from BB.LOD used.
clean broke BGNDPAL
replace from BB.LOD
