===========================================================
This is for the special edition. To confirm some things on files already present:
IMGPAL.ASM  - This is the one from BB.LOD
IMGPAL2.ASM - This is the one from BB2.LOD. It's edited to include IMGTBL2.GLO, assumed renamed from BB2.LOD.
IMGPAL3.ASM - This is the one from BB3.LOD.   .inc IMGTBL.GLO?
IMGPALM.ASM - This is the one from BBMUG.LOD. .inc IMGTBL.GLO?
IMGPALP.ASM - This is the one from BBPAL.LOD. .inc IMGTBL.GLO?
IMGTBL.ASM - Looks a lot like the one from BB.LOD but 91518 91450 and content differs.

Generated:
shadow1
.long   02e96d64H
Included version:
.long   04ea3161H

Note: need to remove the /E parameter from load2.exe generation, this is not dual banked, it's T-Unit!(done)

Testing: Let's keep the old imgtbl.asm for now. Guess it's tied into rom?

NDSP1.asm
 used IMGTBL.GLO from BB
PAL.asm
 used BGNDTBL.GLO from BB
IMGPAL2.asm
 BB.ASM
 IMGTBLP.GLO
PLYRAT.asm
 imgtbl4.glo from BB3
 plyrhd4.tbl from BB3
 RAYGAY_P error. Seems to be removed?? Cut him from plyrhd4 .TBL for now.
PLYR3
 imgtblm.glo from bbmug
 imgtbl3.glo from bbmug
SELECT2
 ray_gay issue in mugshot.tbl
 ken_mug issue . where should this be?
 joe_lin is ok. He's in mugshot.tbl with joe_linp as pal in imgpalm.asm/axx and imgtblm.glo defd.
 Issue is caused by mugshot.tbl it seems a version was included.
 with this done the whole thing compiles but complains of kgrif01 undefined.
 Issue is caused by plyrhd4.tbl being incomplete.

SE runs and boots, but gfx bad again. 
Let's try with the generated imgtbl.asm instead? - also wrong.

TE runs and boots, but gfx bad again. 
Let's try with the generated imgtbl.asm instead? - also wrong.

Gotta debug the .asm.

Start with imgtbl.asm in rom. 
prod has 04ea3161 for shadow1 (+C3FD offset)
ours has 04e96d64 for shadow1

This is where we look at MK2 and NBA JAM TE

IMGTBL.ASM -  	.include imgtbl.glo , 	.include bgndtbl.glo, that's all.

IMGTBL.GLO - 235 globals.
IMGTBL2 - IMGTBL7.GLO, loose files. All the content is together in IMGTBL.GLO. Nothing references these .glo files at any point.

IMGPAL2.ASM - IMGPAL7.ASM, loose files. All .include IMGTBL.GLO

MK2:
NO IMAGES ARE IN IMGTBL.GLO
ONLY PALs are in IMGTBL.GLO

BB.AXX

	.include	"imgtbl.glo"  ? Was included in src. Probably from BB.LOD?
	.include	"imgtblp.glo" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" ? from bb2.lod (uncertain)
	.include	"imgpalp.asm" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgpal2.asm" ? from bb2.lod (certain)

PLYR.AXX 
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" ? from bb2.lod (uncertain)

PLYRAT.AXX
	.include	"imgpalp.asm" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgpal3.asm" ? from bb3.lod (guess! YES)
	.include	"imgtbl4.glo" ? from bb3.lod
	.include	"plyrhd4.tbl" ? from bb3.lod

PLYR3.AXX
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo"
	.include	"bgndtbl.glo"

	.include	"plyrhd2.tbl"
	.include	"imgtblm.glo" ? from BBMUG?
	.include	"imgtbl3.glo" ? from BBMUG?
	.include	"plyrhd3.tbl"

obj's compiled, symbol ref errors.
Easy first. DIAGP in TEST.OBJ
	.include	"imgtbl.glo" does it have DIAGP? Why not?
- it does not have DIAGP
- DIAGP: not in BB.LOD. it is in IMGPAL.ASM from BB2.LOD
- IMGPAL2.ASM is not build as OBJ. Lets do that. And include imgtbl2.glo.
This solves TEST.OBJ!
---
Harder second. SELECT2.OBJ lots. Focus on.. BUTT_P - in IMGTcBL.GLO from BB.LOD and in IMGTBL.ASM.
Needed to replace mostly blank IMGTBL.ASM, see .bak
lots of bmod. BGNDTBL.ASM was fudged from the start for some reason.
---
score.obj
arwbp
IMGPAL.ASM from BB.LOD used.
clean broke BGNDPAL
replace from BB.LOD
