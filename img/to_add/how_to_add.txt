How to add player(s)
--------------------

1. Get images
2. Looking at Ken Griffey

- The player name during select & play goes into imgtbl.asm and imgpal.asm as it's used everywhere.
- Used pal (scorep) is in imgpal.asm.
- You need to generate data for imgpal and imgtbl and store the image.
- There was room in BB3.IRW for this

- The player mug shot goes into mugshot.tbl 
- Used pal goes into imgpalm.asm/axx
- Data is in BBMUG.IRW

- The player heads go into plyrhd4.tbl / imgtbl4.glo
- These are generated from BB3.LOD
- Data is in BB3.IRW
- RAYGAY is cut from BB3.LOD for this.

2. Player src structure
