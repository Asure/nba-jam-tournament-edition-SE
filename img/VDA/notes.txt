To generate a BIN file you need TGA or VDA in 256 col/8bit. Pictview can generate those.
Fullscreen images can be up to 400x255 pixels.

The VDATOBIN tool is set up to take numeric files and generate 'frames' which were used in NBA JAM and Terminator 2.
In later games like MK2 this would be used for character bio screens and a Revolution-X advertisement.
Hangtime used it for the Trophy screen.

File example: You would have DUNK1.VDA/DUNK2.VDA/DUNK3.TGA or simply SCREEN1.TGA.

You would call "VDATOBIN DUNK" to get a .BIN file with 3 images, or "VDA2BIN SCREEN" and so on.

The .BIN file can then be included by crafting a .LOD file, so that load2.exe can create an IRW from it.
This .LOD file looks like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------
;Memory ceiling for LOAD2 is $fffff000 (512 bytes below top)
;***> fff6ba30
***> ffd20000
ASM> BBVDA.TBL
FRM> TROPHY
-------------------------------------------------------------

Contrary to the FRM> directive, this will load the .BIN file instead of the .FRM!

Using load2 you will get a .IRW file than can be included in the LRN file which builds the program rom.

The .IRW contains a header with details where in ROM this data gets mapped.
This is done without regard for any data already there, so you could end up overwriting data!
Look in the mame memory viewer for the rom region to see if your data can be placed there!

The .LRN file should look something like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------
*****
FF800000

2

bbvda.IRW
..\bb.OUT


256

BBZ

A
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can then use this data in the game by calling 'movie_run' which is in UNZIP.ASM/AXX

(Examples in code can be found with find.exe /I "movie_run" *.axx |more in CMD command boxes.)
